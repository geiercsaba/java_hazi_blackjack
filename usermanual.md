## How to Play

1. **Join the Game**: Players can join the game by sitting at one of the three available seats at the table by clicking "New Player" button.

2. **Start the Game**: Players can start the game by clicking the button (New Round)

3. **Place Your Bet**: Once a new game is started, each player will be asked to place their bet one by one through a popup. If a player gives an invalid bet, they will play with a bet of 0.

4. **Deal the Cards**: Each player and the dealer will receive their cards. One of the dealer's cards will be dealt face down.

5. **Make Your Move**: Players will decide one-by-one whether to hit, stand, double, or surrender until their card value is under 21.



## Moves

- **Hit**: A player chooses 'Hit' to take another card. They can continue to do this until they decide to 'Stand' or until their total goes over 21, at which point they lose.

- **Stand**: A player chooses 'Stand' to hold their total and end their turn. 

- **Double**: A player chooses 'Double' to double their bet and take exactly one more card. This ends their turn.

- **Surrender**: A player chooses 'Surrender' to forfeit half of their bet and end their current hand immediately.



## Game Rules

- If a player's total card value exceeds 21, they lose.
